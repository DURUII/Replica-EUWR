# Replica-EUWR: Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Based Unknown Worker Recruitment in Heterogeneous Crowdsensing

> Developed and tested on Apple M1, macOS 13.5.2 (22G91).

## Overview

This repository contains the Python re-implementation of the Unknown Worker Recruitment (UWR) algorithm, which is proposed in the referenced paper:

Our code strives to faithfully replicate the algorithms and experiments described in the paper, allowing for the validation of the paper's assertions.

## Simulation Data

A gaint challenge of reproducing the experiment is the inadequately formulated simulation description. Despite this, we make our utmost effort to adhere to the description provided in the paper [[code](./processor.ipynb)].

The selected tasks are given by blue stars, while the trajectory of the some chosen workers by colorful dots.
