# Replica-EUWR: Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Based Unknown Worker Recruitment in Heterogeneous Crowdsensing

> Developed and tested on Apple M1, macOS 13.5.2 (22G91).

## Overview

This repository contains the Python re-implementation of the Unknown Worker Recruitment (UWR) algorithm, which is
proposed in the referenced paper:

Our code strives to faithfully replicate the algorithms and experiments described in the paper, allowing for the
validation of the paper's assertions.

## Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. To install project dependencies, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Details

### Data Source

This repository utilizes data from [CRAWDAD RomaTaxi](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/crawdad-romataxi). For
similar results, download the dataset and place it in the `./dataset` directory.

### Simulation Data Generation

A gaint challenge of reproducing the experiment is the inadequately formulated simulation description. Despite this, we
make our utmost effort to adhere to the description provided in the
paper [[code](./processor.ipynb), [code](./generator.py)].

The selected tasks are given by blue stars, while the trajectory of some of the chosen workers by colorful dots.

The `generator.py` file also contains the `EasyGenerator` class for simulating data, which randomly generates workers
and tasks. Modify the generation mode in `config.py` to switch between different simulation settings.

### Algorithm Implementation

Due to limited descriptions of compared algorithms in the replicated paper, we implemented the `epsilon-first`, `alpha-optimal`, and `random` algorithms based on our understanding. The proposed algorithm from the paper has been faithfully reproduced according to the provided pseudocode. These implementations can be found in the `./algorithms` directory.
